notes: |

  Use the `<a> `tag if the button is a link to another page, or a link to an anchor within a page. Generally anchors don't require JavaScript to work.
  
  Use the `<button>` tag if the button performs an action that changes something on the current page. `<button>` elements almost always require JavaScript to function.
